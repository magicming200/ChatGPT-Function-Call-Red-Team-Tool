# ChatGPT-Function-Call-Red-Team-Tool
A red team sample tool using ChatGPT function call API. 
## Motivation
There are many example codes for ChatGPT function call api on the Internet, but the integration with specific businesses is not strong, which brings inconvenience to developers, including the integration with network attack and defense business codes, so I wrote a red team sample tool that uses the ChatGPT function call. For reference by developers.
