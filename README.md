# ChatGPT-Function-Call-Red-Team-Tool
A red team sample tool using ChatGPT function call API. 
## Motivation
There are many example codes for ChatGPT function call api on the Internet, but the integration with specific businesses is not strong, which brings inconvenience to developers, including the integration with network attack and defense business codes, so I wrote a red team sample tool that uses the ChatGPT function call. For reference by developers.
## Features
Supports sending attack and defense requirements to chatgpt in natural language, ChatGPT uses function call api to automatically do the following:
- [x] Automatically collect target information: scan ports, collect subdomain names, collect DNS records.
- [x] Automatically exploit vulnerabilities: Currently, it supports exploiting the CVE-2022-22965 vulnerability and returns the exploit results. If the exploit is successful, the webshell address will be returned.
- [x] Automatic analysis of intelligence: currently supports querying the reputation information of target IP and backdoor files.
